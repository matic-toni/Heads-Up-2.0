# Heads Up

Heads Up is an mobile application which detects obstacles in users way while walking. It uses mobile phone's microfon and tries to detect an obstacle from recorded sound using an integrated neuron netwok.

## Description

Pedestrians who use smartphones are often absent-minded, which can lead to a range of mishaps with the potential for both embarrassment and harm. To address this, we have developed HeadsUp, a mobile application that warns the user of impending collisions with solid objects. This can be used on any regular smartphone without extra hardware and uses Doppler effect based active ultrasound sensing.
