# Heads Up

Heads Up is a mobile application which detects obstacles in users' way while walking. It uses a mobile phone's microphone and tries to detect an obstacle from recorded sound using an integrated neuron network.

## Description

Pedestrians who use smartphones are often absent-minded, which can lead to a range of mishaps with the potential for both embarrassment and harm. To address this, we have developed HeadsUp, a mobile application that warns the user of impending collisions with solid objects. This can be used on any regular smartphone without extra hardware and uses Doppler effect-based active ultrasound sensing.
